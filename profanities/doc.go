//profanities is a package that collects a couple of lists of
//swear words name-calling things etc. for use elsewhere.
//
//I have attempted to stay clear of racial slur and otherwise "offensive" stuff
//(anti-homosexual etc.) I have left in some fatshaming - it's all a balance
// The sentences created should rather be funny than low-effort profane
// thus "colorless flan" is alot funnier (and a lot cleverer) than "stupid fuck"
//
// some words are merely added for fun (as they would combine with others)
//
//the lists are compiled from several places:
//  https://www.noswearing.com/
//  https://github.com/zacanger/profane-words/blob/master/words.json
