//profanities is a package that collects a couple of lists of
//swear words name-calling things etc. for use elsewhere.
//
//I have attempted to stay clear of racial slur and otherwise "offensive" stuff
//(anti-homosexual etc.)
//
// some words are merely added for fun (as they would combine with others)
//
//the lists are compiled from several places:
//  https://www.noswearing.com/
