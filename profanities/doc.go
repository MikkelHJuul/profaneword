// profanities is a package that collects a couple of lists of
// swear words name-calling things etc. for use elsewhere.
// I have focused on creating memorable words and include most words of negative connotations;
// While they may not be negative specifically, they are negatively laden.
//
// I have attempted to stay clear of racial slur and otherwise "offensive" stuff
// (anti-homosexual etc.) I have left in some fat shaming - it's all a balance
// The sentences created should rather be funny than low-effort profane
// thus "colorless flan" is alot funnier (and a lot cleverer) than "stupid fuck"; both are accessible
//
// some words are merely added for fun (as they would combine with others to produce funny outputs: "aggressive kitten")
//
// the lists are compiled from several places, and I brainstorm; at this point finding new words is a pastime:
